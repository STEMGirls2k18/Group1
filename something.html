Food and Culture</h1>

<h3>Food can be nostalgic and provide important connections to our family or our nation.
It can be a bridge that helps immigrants find their place in a new society.<br>
It provides us with something more symbolic than simply nutrition.Food is meant to be exchanged and shared with family and friends.<br>
It can make consumption of nutrients differ for different countries. Different habits of eating also make a country different.<br>
It is not only limited to the fork and spoon as cutlery.</h3>
