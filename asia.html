<li>Koh Samui, Thailand</li>
<p style="color:black; font-size:22px;" >
Ko Samui, Thailand’s second largest island, lies in the Gulf of Thailand off the east coast of
the Kra Isthmus. It's known for its palm-fringed beaches, coconut groves and dense, mountainous
rainforest, plus luxury resorts and posh spas. The landmark 12m-tall golden Big Buddha statue
at Wat Phra Yai Temple is located on a tiny island connected to Ko Samui by a causeway.

<li>Ubud, Bali, Indonesia</li>
<p style="color:black; font-size:22px;" >
The town of Ubud, in the uplands of Bali, Indonesia, is known as a center for traditional
crafts and dance. The surrounding Ubud District’s rainforest and terraced rice paddies, dotted
with Hindu temples and shrines, are among Bali’s most famous landscapes. Ancient holy sites
include the intricately carved Goa Gajah (“Elephant Cave”) and Gunung Kawi, with its rock-cut
shrines.

<li>Batad, Philippines</li>
<p style="color:black; font-size:22px;" >
Batad is a village of fewer than 1500 people, situated among the Ifugao rice terraces. It is
perhaps the best place to view this UNESCO World Heritage site. The landscape is truly stunning
and the nearby waterfall offers a lush swimming point (if you have the energy to hike there
and back, around 1 hour each way)

<li>Macleod Island, Burma</li>
<p style="color:black; font-size:22px;" >
Take some time to unwind and recharge in the serene, unspoiled paradise of Myanmar’s MacLeod
Island. One of Southeast Asia’s less frequented destinations, the Mergui Archipelago
is a vast area off the west coast of Myanmar in the Andaman Sea. It is dotted with more than 
800 tropical islands – one of which is MacLeod Island.

<li>Hanoi, Vietnam</li>
<p style="color:black; font-size:22px;" >
Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is known for its centuries-old architecture and a rich culture
with Southeast Asian, Chinese and French influences. At its heart is the chaotic Old Quarter,
where the narrow streets are roughly arranged by trade. There are many little temples,
including Bach Ma, honoring a legendary horse, plus Ð?ng Xuân Market, selling household goods
and street food.

<li>Siem Reap, Cambodia</li>
<p style="color:black; font-size:22px;" >
Siem Reap, a resort town in northwestern Cambodia, is the gateway to the ruins of Angkor, the
seat of the Khmer kingdom from the 9th–15th centuries. Angkor’s vast complex of intricate stone
buildings includes preserved Angkor Wat, the main temple, which is pictured on Cambodia’s flag.
