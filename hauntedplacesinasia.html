<p style="text-align:center;color:blue; font-size:30;"> CHIBICHI OKINAWA {JAPAN}
<p style=";color:white; font-size:22;">
             
             
             Okinawa is well-known for its haunted caves left behind during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. At the end of the war, Japanese soldiers were instructed to commit suicide rather              than surrender to the US army. Many civilians also killed themselves for the same reason. These soldiers and civilians chose to do so in various caves across Okinawa.

             Today, you can find skull sculptures as a memorial to the historical yet tragic events. It is said that you will also see bones belonging to children, who were most probably killed by              their parents themselves to ‘save’ them from the American troops. Visitors often go to the caves to offer prayers to their family members who died there. So if you’re looking for an                adventure or two, plan a trip to Okinawa. It can be pretty exhilarating travelling through these caves

<p style="text-align:center;color:green; font-size:30;"> SHANIWAR WADA {MAHARASHTRA}
<p style=";color:white; font-size:22;">

            The Shaniwar Wada was built by Bajirao I in the 18th century. Bajirao served as the Peshwa or the Prime Minister to the Maratha ruler- Chhatrapati Sahu. The palace was at first                     supposed to be a massive 7-storey stone structure, but after the completion of the base floor, much hue and cry arose. The people objected to the construction on the grounds of the                fact that stone palaces could be sanctioned and built only be the king and not by his Peshwa. Following this, it was decided that the remaining building would be constructed in brick,               and not stone. 

           Shaniwar Wada was finally completed, but little did anyone know that the monument would witness some murky and horrifying times in the days to come. 90 years later, the palace was                  attacked by the British Artillery, which caused the entire six storeys to collapse and fall. Only the stone base remained to testify the grandeur and glory of the period passed. On                 February 27 in 1828, a great mysterious fire started inside the compound. The fire that raged on for seven days razed the entire palace to the ground and what remained were large                   granite ramparts and ruins of the buildings, along with a few strong teak gateways.

<p style="text-align:center;color:orange; font-size:30;"> BHANGAR FORT {RAJASTHAN}
<p style=";color:white; font-size:22;">
The first legend claims that a king named Madho Singh raised the Bhangarh fort after obtaining due permission from an ascetic named Bala Nath who lived there; having agreed to a condition which said that the shadow of the fort must never fall upon the home of the ascetic. But as fate would have it, one of the ambitious successors of Madho Singh added to the fortifications vertically, thereby causing its ominous shadow to engulf the abode of the ascetic. Lo and Behold, once it came to pass, the fort was doomed within no time. The alleged prophecy stood fulfilled, and the Bhangarh Fort became haunted.
<br>
A second legend behind the Bhangarh Fort haunted, more popular than the first one, claims that Princess Ratnavati of Bhangarh was responsible for the apocalyptic situation which befell the fort. A local black magician fell in love with her (the princess is believed to have been very beautiful) and once tried to bewitch a cosmetic she was supposed to use, to make her fall in love with him. The princess smelled suspicion and foiled the entire conspiracy of the black magician by pouring the bewitched cosmetic over a massive stone boulder, which then supposedly crushed the 'tantrik' to death. Before the magician breathed his last, he placed a curse upon the entire landscape that no soul would ever be able to live in peace there. The entire landscape around the Bhangarh Fort has been haunted since.

<p style="text-align:center;color:brown; font-size:30;"> CLARK HOSPITAL {PHILIPPINES}
<br>
<p style=";color:white; font-size:22;">
Clark Hospital was previously a US Army hospital based in the Philippines with a tragic history. During World War II, many people died a brutal death at this place. This hospital also served as an asylum for injured and dying American soldiers at the peak of World War II and the Vietnam War.

It is said to have the highest number of supporting information and testimonials about hauntings and sightings here. Paranormal activity reported by visitors and guards include apparitions, screams, eerie voices, and mysterious footsteps. Apparently, the spirits at the hospital are actually deemed violent. Objects have been thrown at visitors, clearly sending a message that their presence is unwelcomed. It is no surprise that this hospital is considered one of the most haunted places in Asia!

Being an abandoned area it makes the hospital more terrifying but one can visit whenever they want to so there is no particular or appropriate time to go there. The hospital gates are always open for you

<p style="text-align:center;color:pink; font-size:30;"> LAWANG SEWU {INDINESIA}
<p style=";color:white; font-size:22;">
Lawang Sewu is said to be haunted, with many tourists visiting to see the ghosts.[5] Among the ghosts reported to inhabit the establishment are a Dutchwoman who committed suicide inside and "headless ghouls".[5] 
In 2007, a horror film entitled Lawang Sewu: Dendam Kuntilanak (Lawang Sewu: Kuntilanak's Vengeance) was released based on the legend.[11] It told the story of a group of high school students from Jakarta who were trapped in Lawang Sewu after several had to urinate and featured ghosts of a Dutchwoman, a man with a ball and chain wrapped around his leg, and a kuntilanak.[11] 
Lawang Sewu is a historic building tied to colonialism in Indonesia. At the end of World War II, the Indonesia army fought Japanese troops right in front of the building. There are also stories of people being tortured within the walls of the premises. Without a doubt, its gruesome history brought about tales of hauntings and paranormal activity.

Built by the Dutch in mid-19th century as the headquarters for the Dutch Indies Rail Company, there are stories of headless ghosts wandering about the corridors and sightings of a young Dutch lady who apparently committed suicide in the building. Lawang Sewu has a long history and many tales to tell, but it, unfortunately, stands abandoned and dilapidated till today. A 2007 Indonesian horror movie, Lawang Sewu: Dendam Kuntilanak, was also filmed here to depict the eeriness and spooky tales of Lawang Sewu.
